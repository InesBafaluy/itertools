# Itertools Library

## Purpose
Perform a specific operation without the need for defining a full-fledged named function or writing endless for loops.

## Set of lambda functions :

### 1. map
Transform or modify each element in an iterable based on a rule or operation.

### 2. reduce
Perform cumulative computations like finding the sum or product.

### 3. filter
Selectively extract elements from an iterable based on a condition.

### 4. find_index
Locate the position of a particular element within a list or iterable.

### 5. find
Search for a specific element and return it if found.

### 6. group
Categorize or group elements together based on a common property.

### 7. for_each
Perform an action on each element in an iterable without necessarily returning a new list or changing the elements.
