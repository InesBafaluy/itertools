# Itertools Library

## Purpose
The library contains a set of lambda functions, also called anonymous functions, that allow us to perform a specific operation without the need of defining a full-fledged named function or writing endless loops.

## Set of lambda functions :

### 1. map
Transform or modify each element in an iterable based on a rule or operation.

### 2. reduce
Perform cumulative computations like finding the sum or the product.

### 3. filter
Selectively extract elements from an iterable based on a condition.

### 4. find_index
Locate the position of the first element that satisfies a given condition.

### 5. find
Search for the first element that satisfies a given condition.

### 6. group
Categorize or group elements together based on a common property.

### 7. for_each
Perform an action on each element in an iterable without necessarily returning a new list or changing the elements.
